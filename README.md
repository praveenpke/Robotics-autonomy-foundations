# Robotics Autonomy Foundations

This repository contains minimal, reproducible experiments to understand
robotics autonomy systems from a software and evaluation perspective.

Focus areas:
- closed-loop navigation
- planning vs acting
- evaluation pitfalls
- reproducibility and benchmarks

Initial artifact:
- Minimal 2D closed-loop navigation notebook
